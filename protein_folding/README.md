# Protein Folding

This model is an example of a Protein Folding problem formulated as a binary optimization problem using the Gurobi Python 
API and solved with the Gurobi Optimizer.

This model is example 28 from the fifth edition of Model Building in Mathematical Programming, by H. Paul Williams on 
pages 289-290 and 344-345.

This modeling example is at the advanced level, where we assume that you know Python and the Gurobi Python API and 
that you have advanced knowledge of building mathematical optimization models. Typically, the objective function and/or constraints of these examples are complex or require advanced features of the Gurobi Python API.
