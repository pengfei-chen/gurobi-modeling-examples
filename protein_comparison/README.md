# Protein Comparison

This model is an example of a Protein Comparison problem formulated as a quadratic assignment problem using the Gurobi 
Python API and solved with the Gurobi Optimizer.

This model is example 29 from the fifth edition of Model Building in Mathematical Programming by H. Paul Williams 
on pages 290-291 and 345.

This modeling example is at the advanced level, where we assume that you know Python and the Gurobi Python API 
and that you have advanced knowledge of building mathematical optimization models. Typically, the objective function and/or constraints of these examples are complex or require advanced features of the Gurobi Python API.
