# Portfolio Selection Optimization

This model is an example of the classic Markowitz portfolio selection optimization model: to allocate investments 
to minimize risk. This is best suited to a matrix formulation, so we use the Gurobi Python matrix interface. 
The basic model is fairly simple, so we also solve it parametrically to find the efficient frontier.
