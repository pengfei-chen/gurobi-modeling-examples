# Modeling Session 1 - More Widget Distribution Optimization

## Problem
Given demand data produced by a hypothetical machine learning model, as well as transportation costs and production capacity, determine the optimal production and shipment of widgets from a set of production facilities to distribution locations that minimize cost. 

This is an extension of the same example from Opti 101's first modeling session.

## Beware Spoilers!
We also put **completed** versions of the modeling notebook and the exercise in the repo. If you want to work through the notebooks without everything filled in make sure not to open the completed versions.
