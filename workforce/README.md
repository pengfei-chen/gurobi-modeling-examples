# Workforce Scheduling Problem

This  Jupyter Notebook describes a workforce scheduling optimization problem that is common in the services industry. 
The problem is formulated as a multi-objective mixed-integer-programming (MIP) model.
The model is implemented using the Gurobi Python API and solved using the Gurobi Optimizer. 

This modeling example is at the advanced level, where we assume that you know Python and the Gurobi Python API and 
that you have advanced knowledge of building mathematical optimization models. Typically, the objective function 
and/or constraints of these examples are complex or require advanced features of the Gurobi Python API.
