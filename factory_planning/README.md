# Factory Planning

---
## Factory Planning 1
This model is an example of a production planning problem. In such problems, the goal is to create an 
optimal production plan to maximize profit.

More information on this type of model can be found in example # 3 of the fifth edition of Modeling 
Building in Mathematical Programming by H. P. Williams on pages 255-256 and 300-302.

This modeling example is at the intermediate level, where we assume that you know Python and are familiar with 
the Gurobi Python API. In addition, you should have some knowledge about building mathematical optimization models.

## Factory Planning 2
This model extends the Factory Planning I example above to add complexity whereby the month where each machine is 
down will, instead of being fixed, be determined as a part of the optimized plan.

More information on this type of model can be found in example # 4 of the fifth edition of Modeling Building in 
Mathematical Programming by H. P. Williams on pages 256 and 302-303.

This modeling example is at the intermediate level, where we assume that you know Python and are familiar with 
the Gurobi Python API. In addition, you should have some knowledge about building mathematical optimization models.
