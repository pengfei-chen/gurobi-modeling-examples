# Opencast Mining

This model is an example of a production planning problem. A mining company wants to identify which excavation locations 
to choose in order to maximize the gross margins of extracting ore. This problem is a binary optimization problem that 
can be formulated as a linear programming problem using the Gurobi Python API and solved with the Gurobi Optimizer.

This model is example 14 from the fifth edition of Model Building in Mathematical Programming, by H. Paul Williams 
on pages 269-270 and 324-325.

This example is at the intermediate level where we assume that you know Python and the Gurobi Python API and that 
you have some knowledge of building mathematical optimization models.
