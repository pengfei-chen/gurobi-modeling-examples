# Mixed Integer Linear Programming Tutorial

The goal of the modeling examples is to introduce the key components in the formulation of mixed integer programming (MIP) problems.
The models are part of the [Mixed Integer Linear Programming Tutorial](https://www.gurobi.com/resource/tutorial-mixed-integer-linear-programming/).  This video tutorial takes you through the foundationsal principles of Mixed-Integer Linear programming (MILP).  You wil learn why MILP is important, methods for solving a MIP problem, the advantages of using MIP instead of heuristics, and more.

## Start the tutorial

To get started with this video series, go to [Mixed Integer Linear Programming Tutorial](https://www.gurobi.com/resources/chapter-1-why-mixed-integer-programming-mip/)
