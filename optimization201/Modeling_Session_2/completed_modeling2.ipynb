This example is motivated by [IEEE's Predict+Optimize Technical Challenge](https://ieee-dataport.org/competitions/ieee-cis-technical-challenge-predictoptimize-renewable-energy-scheduling) in 2021.\n","\n","In this example we are trying to minimize the amount of electricity purchased from the grid to supply a building with electricity over a 6-day period while meeting predicted demand. The building is outfitted with solar panels and two batteries to store and provide energy when appropriate. Decisions made at each 30-minute interval are:\n","1. Buy electricity from the grid\n","2. Charge/discharge the one battery\n","3. Charge/discharge the other battery\n","\n","The output of the optimization model is a charge/discharge schedule for the batteries as well as the time periods where electricity will be purchased. The demand is forecasted using [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/). The notebook for this part of the problem can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Gurobi/modeling-examples/blob/master/optimization101/Modeling_Session_2/energy_storage_ML.ipynb) If you want to have the first notebook handy, you can find it [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Gurobi/modeling-examples/blob/master/optimization101/Modeling_Session_2/completed_modeling2.ipynb).\n","\n","This model is a lot more complicated that the first from Opti 101, so we can copy the formulation and code in a concise way and highlight the parts relevant to the features discussed in the second modeling session video.\n","\n","In
