# 3D Tic-Tac-Toe

This model solves the problem of arranging  X's and 0's on a three-dimensional Tic-Tac-Toe board so as to minimize the 
number of completed lines or diagonals. It demonstrates the use of mixed integer programming to capture simple logical 
constraints.

This is example 17 from the fifth edition of Model Building in Mathematical Programming, by H. Paul Williams on pages 272 
and 327-328.

This modeling example is at the beginning level. We assume that you have some familiarity with Python and the Gurobi 
Python API, but you can hopefully pick up any missing concepts from the example.
