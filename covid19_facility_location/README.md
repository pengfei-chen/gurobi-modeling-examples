# COVID-19: Healthcare Facility Capacity Optimization

## Objective and Prerequisites

This COVID-19 Healthcare Facility Capacity Optimization problem -which is a variation of the problem described in the 
[Facility Location](https://www.gurobi.com/resource/facility-location-problem/) Jupyter Notebook - shows you how to 
determine the optimal location and capacity of healthcare facilities in order to:

* Satisfy demand from COVID-19 patients for treatment,
* Minimize the cost of opening temporary facilities for healthcare providers, and
* Predict the allocation of COVID-19 patients from a specific county to a specific healthcare facility.

This modeling example is at the beginner level, where we assume that you know Python and that you have some knowledge of 
how to build mathematical optimization models.
