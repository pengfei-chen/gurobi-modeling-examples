## Electrical Power 1

This model is an example of an electrical power generation problem (also known as a unit commitment problem). It selects 
an optimal set of power stations to turn on in order to satisfy anticipated power demand over a 24-hour time horizon.

This model is example 15 from the fifth edition of Model Building in Mathematical Programming, by H. Paul Williams on 
pages 270-271 and 325-326.

This example is of intermediate difficulty; we assume that you know Python and the Gurobi Python API and that you have 
some knowledge of building mathematical optimization models.

## Electrical Power 2

This model is an extension of an earlier 'Electrical Power 1 ' example (example 15 from HP Williams); the extension adds 
the option of using hydroelectric power plants to satisfy demand.

This model is example 16 from the fifth edition of Model Building in Mathematical Programming, by H. Paul Williams on 
pages 271-272 and 326-327.

This example is of intermediate difficulty; we assume that you know Python and the Gurobi Python API and that you have 
some knowledge of building mathematical optimization models.
