# Price Optimization with Competing Products

This example considers the pricing of similar products that a seller is offering with a limited amount of space. For example, this could be shelves in retail, warehouses in e-commerce, seats in event or airline ticketing, or room in a hotel. The goal is to use data and machine learning to model the price/demand relationship, then determine the optimal the number of products for maximum revenue. This example uses the Gurobi-sponsored open-source package [Gurobi Machine Learning](https://gurobi-machinelearning.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#).
